          This Privacy Policy explains how CK Consulting LTD ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the CeeK OpenAI API Assistant ("the Service").
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          We collect only the minimum information necessary to provide you with the Service. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you register for an account, we collect your email address and a password. If you use third-party authentication providers (Google or GitHub), we receive basic profile information from these providers as permitted by your privacy settings with them.</li>

          <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect information about how you interact with the Service, such as the features you use and the time spent on the Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
        <p>
          We do not collect any additional personal information beyond what you explicitly provide to us or what is necessary for the functioning of the Service.
        </p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          We use the information we collect for the following purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>To provide and maintain the Service</li>
          <li>To authenticate your identity and maintain your account</li>

          <li>To protect the security and integrity of the Service</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          The Service interfaces with several third-party services:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Your interactions with our Service often involve sending data to OpenAI's API. These interactions are subject to OpenAI's privacy policy and terms of use.</li>
          <li><strong>Authentication Providers:</strong> If you choose to sign in using Google or GitHub, your interaction with these services is governed by their respective privacy policies. We only receive the information these services are configured to share with us.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the Service. You can request deletion of your account and associated data at any time. However, we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
