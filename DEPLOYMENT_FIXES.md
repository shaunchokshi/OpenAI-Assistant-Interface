# Deployment Fixes for Authentication Issues

This guide documents the fixes implemented to resolve authentication issues in the Docker deployment.

## IMPORTANT: Changes Made in Latest Update (May 13, 2025)

The most recent fixes address the syntax error in the Dockerfile:

1. Created `production-server.js` directly in the repository instead of attempting to generate it in the Dockerfile
2. Fixed build process to properly handle client and server files with correct directory structure
3. Made sure all scripts are properly copied and have executable permissions

## Issues Fixed

1. **Database Connection Issue:**
   - Removed the `@neondatabase/serverless` package which was causing connection problems
   - Updated database client to use standard PostgreSQL connections
   - Fixed environment variables in Docker Compose configuration

2. **Production Build Issue:**
   - Created a dedicated production server that doesn't rely on Vite plugins
   - Ensured all necessary production dependencies are installed
   - Modified the build process to prevent build-time errors

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Deploy with docker-compose.yml

```bash
# Build the containers with no cache to ensure fresh dependencies
docker-compose build --no-cache

# Start the services
docker-compose up -d

# Check logs for any issues
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Option 2: Deploy with Production Configuration

```bash
# Use the production-specific configuration
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build --no-cache

# Start the services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Check logs for any issues
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f
```

## Testing the Database Connection

You can verify the database connection is working with:

```bash
# Run the database check script
docker-compose exec app node --experimental-specifier-resolution=node check-database.js
```

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. Check the PostgreSQL container is running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

2. Verify environment variables are set correctly:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec app env | grep PG
   ```

3. Check the database connection logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec app node --experimental-specifier-resolution=node check-database.js
   ```

4. If needed, rebuild without cache:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
