## Reporting Security Issues

The OpenAI Assistant application takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to [security@yourdomain.com](mailto:security@yourdomain.com). You should receive a response within 48 hours.

Please include the following information in your report:
- Type of issue
- Full path of the affected files
- Location of the source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

## Security Best Practices for Deployment

### Environment Variables and Secrets
- Never store secrets or API keys in the codebase
- Always use environment variables for sensitive data
- Rotate secrets periodically (especially API keys)
- Use different secrets for development and production

### Database Security
- Ensure database connections use TLS/SSL encryption
- Use strong passwords for database access
- Restrict database access to necessary IP addresses
- Regularly back up your database
- Apply database security patches promptly

### Authentication
- Use HTTP-only cookies for session storage
- Implement proper CSRF protection
- Use strong password hashing (bcrypt)
- Enforce strong password policies
- Implement rate limiting on login attempts
- Use proper OAuth flows for third-party authentication

### API Security
- Validate all input data
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Set appropriate CORS headers
- Rate limit API endpoints
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information

### Infrastructure Security
- Keep server software up to date
- Use a firewall to restrict access to necessary ports
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Set up automated security scanning
- Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities regularly

### Content Security
- Implement proper Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Sanitize user-generated content
- Validate file uploads and restrict to safe file types
- Scan uploaded files for malware
- Store uploaded files in a secure location
